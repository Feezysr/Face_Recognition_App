Face Recognition app

Overview

This project is a Face Recognition System that identifies and verifies individuals based on facial features. The system uses FaceNet for feature extraction and Haar Cascade for face detection, ensuring high accuracy and real-time processing.

Features

Face Detection: Uses Haar Cascade to detect faces in images and video streams.

Feature Extraction: Employs FaceNet to generate unique facial embeddings for each individual.

Face Recognition: Compares embeddings to determine identity with high accuracy.

Real-time Processing: Optimized for fast and efficient recognition.

Scalability: Can be expanded to support multiple individuals and datasets.

Technologies Used

Python

OpenCV (Haar Cascade for face detection)

TensorFlow/Keras (FaceNet for feature extraction)

NumPy & Pandas (Data handling)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data visualization)

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-recognition-system.git
cd face-recognition-system

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the application:

python face_recognition.py

Usage

Add new faces: Train the system with known faces.

Detect and recognize: The system will identify individuals in real-time.

Improve accuracy: Add more training images for better recognition.

Future Improvements

Implement deep learning-based detection models (e.g., MTCNN).

Enhance performance on large-scale datasets.

Deploy the system as a web or mobile application.
